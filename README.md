# IncludeAI

**IncludeAI** is a custom, hand-written implementation of a **Zero-Knowledge Reinforcement Learning** algorithm that, unlike AlphaZero, does not suffer from the [shallow trap](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/04/27) problem and should (given enough resources) be able to play games with *complete information*[^1] perfectly.

## TAKE YOUR GAME-AI TO THE NEXT LEVEL!!!

Start a program with `#include <includeai.hpp>` to literally include an [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb/)-style single-header library providing you with a General Game Playing, aka. *Effective Decision Making with Uncertain or Incomplete Information* (EDMUII), AI.
The goal of this library is to implement [Artificial General Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) as a single-header drop-in library. Quick deployment and ease-of-use are priotitized.
*General Game Playing*, while sounding fun, is the second most difficult problem in the universe, far surpassing quantum physics, elliptic curve arithmetic and axionic singularity modulation, but slightly "easier" than mapping homomorphic endofunctors to manifolds of Hilbert space. As such, it remains an ongoing research project! Thread carefully ðŸ”¬


### Building
Not necessary, just copying 'includeai.hpp' into your project should be enough. If you want to "build" it anyway here is how:
1. 'python3 generate.py'
2. profit

### Install
1. '#define INCLUDEAI_IMPLEMENTATION' in ONE source file before `#include`ing includeai.hpp
2. Inspect the examples (in the `example` folder) on how to use
3. Build your project using a compiler from the 21st century. I don't know which one, maybe `gcc` or `clang`? If you get some errors try updating your compiler to the latest version.
4. Profit...

### Features
- no dynamic memory
- simple API
- drop-in library. No CMAKE, Autotools, etc needed!
- no trap states ([See below](#about-trap-states))
- no dependencies (other than stdlib)
- cross platform (tries to be...)
- fast?

### How to use
Create an `Ai_ctx` object. This object stores the entire ai memory and can be rather large. For example, during testing the game Yavalath more than 90000 nodes are required. With less, due to early exhausted memory, the stopping condition may be triggered before all iterations are completed, potentially resulting in lower-quality outcomes. Finding the right number of nodes for your use-case requires careful testing and calibration.
The template parameters for Ai_ctx are `<int NumNodes, GameMove MoveType, BitfieldMemoryType BitfieldType, class Pattern, int MaxPatterns>`. If you decide to store your moves/actions as a uint64_t and your bitfield type is also uint64_t, the size of the Ai_ctx object could be something like `(NumNodes * sizeof(Node<uint64_t>)) + ((NumNodes/64) * sizeof(uint64_t)) + (MaxPatterns * sizeof(Pattern))`. Hope thats clear... Other than putting it somewhere into memory there is nothing you need to do with Ai_ctx. Theoretically a single Ai_ctx object can be resued for multiple AI players since it does not store game state. However, if AI players play concurrently, as opposed to taking turns, then each one needs their own Ai_ctx to avoid cuncurrency issues. The Ai_ctx should be created once at start and persist during the whole game, for example one round of chess, start to checkmate. But you must pay attention to pass the correct `Gameview` for each player when calling `mcts`, since those might differ from the perspective of each player.
Calling `mcts<Iterations, Max simulation depth, Minimax depth, Move type, Bitfield Int type>(Gameworld/board/view, Ai_ctx, random number functor)` will return a `MCTS_result`. Accessing `MCTS_result.best` will give you the ai's favorite move for the given board position, the type of which will be your `Move` type. For example if you `mcts<500, 10, 5, unsigned int, ...` your `MCTS_result.best` will be an 'unsigned int'.

### WASM support
It should work. See how to include above^, compile with SIMD enabled: `em++ mygame.cpp -o mygame.js -s WASM=1 -s SIMD=1`

### About Trap States
Trap states are fundamentally a resource issue. Shown here is an example of the game Yavalath:
```
// a = ai
// p = player
// X = last move made

// called with 350 iterations, and 50000 nodes pre-allocated:
Ai_ctx<50000, YavalathBoard::YavMove, unsigned int, PatternType, MaxPatterns> ai_ctx;
MCTS_result mcts_res = mcts<350, 21, 3, YavalathBoard::YavMove, UQWORD>(view, ai_ctx, randFn);

    . . . . .                        . . . . .                         . . . . .

```
Improved version:
```
// called with 1000 iterations, and 100000 nodes pre-allocated:
Ai_ctx<100000, YavalathBoard::YavMove, unsigned int, PatternType, MaxPatterns> ai_ctx;
MCTS_result mcts_res = mcts<1000, 21, 3, YavalathBoard::YavMove, UQWORD>(view, ai_ctx, randFn);

    . . . . .                          . . . . .                     
   . . . . . .                        . . . . . .

  . . . . . . .      player          . . . . . . .                    
   a a p a . .                        a a p a . .                     
    . . . . .                          . . . . .                        
                                                                                       
```
Some initial tests suggest that past a number of iterations of about 8-9000 (and ~600000+ nodes), the AI becomes effectively undefeatable. These numbers may be more or less depending on you game/usecase/etc.


### Limitations / Assumtions
While there is no limitation on the number of players (2,3,4...), and it is possible for a player to take two consecutive turns, it is assumed that each player plays one move/action before ending their turn (see note below!). That means that compound moves, such as moving 4 steps forward and 1 step left should be consolidated into a single move instead of taking 5 turns!
In coop games, where multiple players work together, the `getWinner()` function should always return the current player if an allied player wins. For example, if player 1 and 2 are on the same team, and player 2 scores a victory during player 1's turn, the `getWinner()` should return `1` even if player 2 is making the winning move! A victory by any allied player should be considered equivalent to a victory by the current (maximizing) player.
NOTE: 'turn' does not strictly imply a restriction to the use of this library in turn based games alone! It should be possible to run this in a background thread continuously polling best moves at a certain frequency without having to wait for another player to make a 'move'.
